## Overview

FIM Agent is a provider-agnostic Python framework for building AI agents that dynamically plan and execute complex tasks. It operates in two modes:

- **Standalone (Portal)**: A full-featured AI assistant with dynamic DAG planning, concurrent execution, and real-time streaming. The LLM decomposes goals into dependency-aware DAGs at runtime, runs independent steps in parallel, and re-plans if needed.
- **Sidecar (Embedded Engine)**: An embeddable runtime that proactively bridges into legacy systems, reading their databases, calling their APIs, and pushing notifications, all without requiring a single line of code change on the host side.

Both modes share the same agent core: ReAct reasoning loops, pluggable tools, and a protocol-first architecture with zero vendor lock-in.

## Why FIM Agent

Enterprise clients don't want "another system to maintain". Their legacy systems (ERP such as SAP, Kingdee/金蝶, Yonyou/用友; CRM such as Salesforce, Fanruan/帆软; OA such as Seeyon/致远, Weaver/泛微; finance; HR) are often **frozen**: untouchable codebases with decades of business logic baked in.

FIM Agent solves this with two integration directions:

```
┌─ If they CAN'T modify their system (90% of cases) ───────────────┐
│                                                                    │
│  FIM Agent ──→ reads their DB directly (bypass app layer)         │
│            ──→ calls their existing APIs / RPCs                   │
│            ──→ pushes results to DingTalk (钉钉) / WeCom (企微)   │
│                 / Slack / Teams / email                            │
│            ──→ writes back via DB or API when authorized          │
│                                                                    │
│  Zero code change on their side. Agent = active "digital worker". │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ If they CAN modify their system (bonus) ─────────────────────────┐
│                                                                    │
│  Their system ──→ calls FIM Agent API (like calling Dify)         │
│  FIM Agent exposes: /api/execute, /api/stream, /api/kb            │
│                                                                    │
│  Standard API integration. We expose, they consume.               │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**vs Dify / n8n**: Static workflow engines that require the host system to call *their* API. If the host can't be modified, the project stalls. FIM Agent goes the other direction: the agent reaches into the host.

**vs Manus / AutoGPT**: Single-use autonomous agents with no platform layer. FIM Agent adds multi-tenant management, persistent conversations, knowledge bases, and an Adapter protocol that standardizes how agents connect to external systems.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic DAG Planning**: The LLM decomposes goals into dependency graphs at runtime. No hard-coded workflows.
- **DAG Visualization**: Interactive flow graph (@xyflow/react) in an expand/collapse right sidebar with real-time step status, dependency edges, click-to-scroll navigation, and auto fitView. ReAct mode shows a compact step timeline.
- **DAG Re-Planning**: When the goal is not achieved, the planner automatically revises the plan using step results as context and retries, up to 3 rounds.
- **Concurrent Execution**: Independent DAG steps run in parallel via `asyncio`, bounded by a configurable concurrency limit.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Portal streams reasoning steps and tool calls as they happen via SSE, with KaTeX math rendering support.
- **ReAct Agent**: Structured reasoning-and-acting loop with JSON-based tool calls, automatic error recovery, and iteration limits.
- **OpenAI-Compatible**: Works with any provider exposing the `/v1/chat/completions` interface (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Ollama, vLLM, and others).
- **Pluggable Tool System**: Protocol-based tool interface with auto-discovery. Ships with Python executor, calculator, file ops, web search/fetch (Jina), HTTP request (any REST API), and sandboxed shell exec (curl, jq, etc.).
- **Multi-Tenant Platform**: JWT auth with token-based SSE authentication, conversation ownership validation, per-user resource isolation.
- **Agent Management**: Create, configure, and publish agents with bound LLM model, tool categories, and custom instructions. Chat endpoints automatically resolve agent config.
- **RAG Ready**: Abstract `BaseRetriever` / `Document` interface for plugging in vector stores and search backends.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only three runtime dependencies: `openai`, `httpx`, `pydantic`.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add fim-agent

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/fim-ai/fim-agent.git
cd fim-agent
uv sync
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
import os

from fim_agent.core.agent import ReActAgent
from fim_agent.core.model import OpenAICompatibleLLM
from fim_agent.core.tool import ToolRegistry
from fim_agent.core.tool.builtin.python_exec import PythonExecTool


async def main() -> None:
    llm = OpenAICompatibleLLM(
        api_key=os.environ["LLM_API_KEY"],
        base_url=os.environ.get("LLM_BASE_URL", "https://api.openai.com/v1"),
        model=os.environ.get("LLM_MODEL", "gpt-4o"),
    )

    tools = ToolRegistry()
    tools.register(PythonExecTool())

    agent = ReActAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools)
    result = await agent.run("Calculate the factorial of 10 using Python.")
    print(result.answer)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### DAG Planning

```python
from fim_agent.core.planner import DAGPlanner, DAGExecutor, PlanAnalyzer

planner = DAGPlanner(llm=llm)
plan = await planner.plan("Compare bubble sort vs built-in sorted() on 5000 random ints.")

executor = DAGExecutor(agent=agent, max_concurrency=3)
plan = await executor.execute(plan)

analyzer = PlanAnalyzer(llm=llm)
analysis = await analyzer.analyze(plan.goal, plan)
print(analysis.final_answer)
```

See [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) for a complete runnable example.

### Running

```bash
# Create .env with your LLM credentials
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env with your API key

# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra web
cd frontend && pnpm install && cd ..

# Start
./start.sh            # Next.js portal + API backend (default)
./start.sh api        # API only (for custom frontends or testing)
```

| Command | What starts | URL |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `./start.sh` | Next.js + FastAPI | http://localhost:3000 (UI) + :8000 (API) |
| `./start.sh api` | FastAPI only | http://localhost:8000/api |

The portal offers two modes: **ReAct Agent** (single-query tool loop) and **DAG Planner** (multi-step planning with concurrent execution), with real-time SSE streaming, DAG visualization, and KaTeX math rendering.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Yes | | API key for the LLM provider |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible API |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4o` | Model identifier to use |
| `LLM_TEMPERATURE` | No | `0.7` | Default sampling temperature |
| `MAX_CONCURRENCY` | No | `5` | Max parallel steps in DAG executor |

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=fim_agent --cov-report=term-missing

## Roadmap

> Goal: Build a provider-agnostic Agent Platform, from standalone AI assistant to embeddable sidecar engine that modernizes legacy systems without modifying them.

**Shipped**: v0.1 (ReAct Agent, DAG Planning, streaming, KaTeX) → v0.2 (memory, multi-model, token tracking, native function calling) → v0.3 (web/calculator/file tools, MCP client, tool auto-discovery & categories, DAG visualization, sidebar UX, sandbox hardening) → v0.4 (persistence, multi-turn conversation, JWT auth with SSE token support, agent-aware chat with per-agent model/tools/instructions binding, file upload management, HTTP request & shell exec tools) → v0.5 in progress (LLM Compact for conversation history compression, DAG Re-Planning with automatic retry up to 3 rounds).

**Next**: RAG, knowledge base & remaining v0.5 items (semantic memory, conversation summary) → System Adapter protocol for bridging into legacy DBs/APIs/message buses (v0.6) → Human confirmation + embeddable UI (v0.7) → Declarative adapters (v0.8) → Observability (v0.9) → Enterprise & scale (v1.0).
