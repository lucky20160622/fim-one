"""ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent implementation.

This module provides a ``ReActAgent`` that uses structured JSON output from an
LLM to drive an iterative tool-use loop.  It also supports an optional *native*
function-calling mode where the LLM produces ``tool_calls`` directly (OpenAI
style) instead of emitting JSON action objects.

You are an intelligent assistant that solves tasks by reasoning step-by-step \
and using tools when necessary.

Current date and time: {current_datetime} (the current year is {current_year}). \
When searching for up-to-date information, always use the current year \
({current_year}) in your queries, NOT a previous year.

You MUST respond with a single JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) in \
one of the following two formats:

1. To call a tool:
{{
  "type": "tool_call",
  "reasoning": "<your step-by-step reasoning>",
  "tool_name": "<name of the tool>",
  "tool_args": {{<arguments as key-value pairs>}}
}}

2. To give the final answer:
{{
  "type": "final_answer",
  "reasoning": "<your step-by-step reasoning>",
  "answer": "<your final answer>"
}}

Available tools:
{tool_descriptions}

Guidelines:
- Always explain your reasoning before acting.
- Use tools only when the task requires external information or computation.
- When you have enough information, produce a final_answer immediately.
- If a tool call fails, analyse the error and decide whether to retry with \
different arguments or produce a final answer with the information you have.
- Be EFFICIENT: try to accomplish as much as possible in each tool call. \
Write a single comprehensive script rather than making many small calls. \
For example, generate data AND analyse it in one script when feasible.
- Keep your final_answer concise and focused -- present key results, not \
lengthy commentary or step-by-step narration of what you did.
- Do NOT generate charts, plots, or images (e.g. matplotlib) unless the user \
explicitly asks for visualisation. Prefer text tables and formatted output.
- LANGUAGE: Always respond in the same language as the user's query. If the \
user writes in Chinese, your reasoning and final_answer must be in Chinese. \
If the user writes in English, respond in English. Match the user's language.
- CRITICAL: Your ENTIRE response must be a single JSON object. No markdown, no plain text, no code fences.
- Even for long final answers, always wrap the content in the {{"type": "final_answer", ...}} JSON structure.
- If your answer contains markdown formatting, put it INSIDE the "answer" field as a JSON string.

class ReActAgent:
    """A ReAct agent that reasons and acts through structured JSON output.

    The agent maintains a growing conversation history.  At each iteration it
    asks the LLM for a JSON action, executes any requested tool call, appends
    the observation, and continues until a ``final_answer`` is produced or the
    maximum iteration count is reached.

    When ``use_native_tools=True`` and the LLM advertises ``tool_call``
    capability, the agent delegates tool invocation to the LLM's native
    function-calling interface instead of parsing JSON actions.

    Args:
        llm: The language model backend to use for reasoning.
        tools: A registry of tools the agent may invoke.
        system_prompt: An optional override for the default system prompt.
            When provided the default ReAct instructions are *replaced*
            entirely -- make sure to include tool descriptions yourself.
        extra_instructions: Optional additional instructions appended to the
            default system prompt.  Unlike ``system_prompt``, these are
            *merged* with the default template rather than replacing it.
            Ideal for per-agent customisation (e.g. "You are a financial
            analyst...").
        max_iterations: Safety limit on reasoning iterations.
        use_native_tools: Whether to prefer the LLM's native function-calling
            interface.  The feature is only activated when the LLM also
            advertises ``tool_call`` capability.
        memory: Optional conversation memory for multi-turn sessions.
