_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """\
You are an execution-mode classifier for an AI agent system.

Given a user query, decide:

1. **mode** — how to execute:
- "react": Simple, single-step, conversational, or exploratory queries. \
Queries that need back-and-forth or are open-ended.
- "dag": Complex, multi-step tasks that can be decomposed into independent \
subtasks with dependencies. Tasks that benefit from parallel execution.

2. **domain_hint** — the specialist domain (or null for general):
{domain_block}

## Domain-aware routing guidance
- Queries in specialist domains that require **deep analysis \
or report writing** → prefer "react".  These domains have tightly coupled \
analysis dimensions; splitting into DAG steps loses cross-reference context \
and increases citation hallucination risk.
- Domain queries that are clearly decomposable with **independent subtasks** \
(e.g. "check trademark status in 5 separate countries") → "dag" is fine.
- When in doubt for domain queries, prefer "react" — a single capable agent \
with full context produces higher-accuracy results.

## Examples
- "What is the weather?" -> react, null
- "Summarize this document" -> react, null
- "Find all customers who churned last month, analyze the reasons, and \
draft an email campaign" -> dag, null
- "Evaluate the legal risks of using a competitor's brand name" -> react, legal
- "Compare drug efficacy across 3 clinical trials" -> react, medical
- "Research competitor pricing in 5 markets, create comparison table" -> dag, null
- "Hello" -> react, null

## Query
{{query}}

Respond with JSON: {{{{"mode": "react" or "dag", "domain_hint": one of {domain_names_str} or null, "reasoning": "brief explanation"}}}}
