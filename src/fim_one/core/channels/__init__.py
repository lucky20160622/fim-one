"""Channel abstraction layer for outbound messaging integrations.

A Channel is a platform-specific adapter that can ``send_message()`` to an
IM system (Feishu / WeCom / Slack / ...) and ``handle_callback()`` for
interactive events (button clicks, form submissions).

Channels are registered in :mod:`registry` by their ``type`` string (e.g.
``"feishu"``) so the API layer can look up the right class from a row in
the ``channels`` table.
