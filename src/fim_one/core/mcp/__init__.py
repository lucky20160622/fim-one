"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) client integration.

Provides :class:`MCPClient` for connecting to external MCP servers and
:class:`MCPToolAdapter` for wrapping MCP tools into the FIM One ``Tool``
protocol.  :class:`MCPServerMetaTool` consolidates all MCP tools behind a
single tool with ``discover``/``call`` subcommands (progressive disclosure).

The ``mcp`` package is an optional dependency — import errors are deferred
so the rest of the framework works without it installed.
