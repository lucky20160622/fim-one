When searching for up-to-date information, always use the current year \
({current_year}) in your queries, NOT a previous year.

You MUST respond with a single JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) in \
one of the following two formats:

1. To call a tool:
{{
  "type": "tool_call",
  "reasoning": "<your step-by-step reasoning>",
  "tool_name": "<name of the tool>",
  "tool_args": {{<arguments as key-value pairs>}}
}}

2. To signal you are done (no more tools needed):
{{
  "type": "final_answer",
  "reasoning": "<your step-by-step reasoning>",
  "answer": "<concise summary of key findings and results>"
}}

Available tools:
{tool_descriptions}

Guidelines:
- Always explain your reasoning before acting.
- Use tools only when the task requires external information or computation.
- When you have enough information, produce a final_answer immediately.
- If a tool call fails, analyse the error and decide whether to retry with \
different arguments or produce a final answer with the information you have.
- Be EFFICIENT: try to accomplish as much as possible in each tool call. \
Write a single comprehensive script rather than making many small calls. \
For example, generate data AND analyse it in one script when feasible.
- IMPORTANT: In the "answer" field, write a concise summary of the key findings \
and results you gathered (NOT the full polished answer — a separate synthesis \
step handles that). Focus on facts, data points, and conclusions. Keep it brief \
but substantive. Do NOT use python_exec just to print/format results — write \
the summary directly in the "answer" field instead.
- Do NOT generate charts, plots, or images (e.g. matplotlib) unless the user \
explicitly asks for visualisation. Prefer text tables and formatted output.
- If you need a tool that is not listed above, use request_tools to load it \
(when available). The request_tools description lists all unloaded tools.
- LANGUAGE: By default, respond in the same language as the user's query. \
However, if an Agent Directive specifies different language behaviour \
(e.g. a translation agent), follow the Agent Directive instead.

class ReActAgent:
    """A ReAct agent that reasons and acts through structured JSON output.

    The agent maintains a growing conversation history.  At each iteration it
    asks the LLM for a JSON action, executes any requested tool call, appends
    the observation, and continues until a ``final_answer`` is produced or the
    maximum iteration count is reached.

    When ``use_native_tools=True`` and the LLM advertises ``tool_call``
    capability, the agent delegates tool invocation to the LLM's native
    function-calling interface instead of parsing JSON actions.

    Args:
        llm: The language model backend to use for reasoning.
        tools: A registry of tools the agent may invoke.
        system_prompt: An optional override for the default system prompt.
            When provided the default ReAct instructions are *replaced*
            entirely -- make sure to include tool descriptions yourself.
        extra_instructions: Optional additional instructions appended to the
            default system prompt.  Unlike ``system_prompt``, these are
            *merged* with the default template rather than replacing it.
            Ideal for per-agent customisation (e.g. "You are a financial
            analyst...").
        max_iterations: Safety limit on reasoning iterations.
        use_native_tools: Whether to prefer the LLM's native function-calling
            interface.  The feature is only activated when the LLM also
            advertises ``tool_call`` capability.
        memory: Optional conversation memory for multi-turn sessions.
        context_guard: Optional context-window budget manager.  When
            provided, messages are checked against a token budget before
            each LLM call and compacted if necessary.
        hook_registry: Optional hook registry for deterministic enforcement
            hooks that run outside the LLM loop.  When provided, hooks
            are executed at PRE_TOOL_USE, POST_TOOL_USE, and SESSION_START
            points automatically.
        workspace: Optional per-conversation workspace for offloading large
            tool outputs.  When provided, workspace tools are auto-registered
            and tool outputs exceeding the offload threshold are saved to
            files with a preview injected into the conversation.
        agent_directive: Optional agent-level instructions that define the
            agent's core purpose (e.g. "translate Chinese to English").
            Unlike ``extra_instructions`` (which bundles Skills, KB hints,
            and preferences), this is injected into the **synthesis** step
            so the final answer honours the agent's identity.
