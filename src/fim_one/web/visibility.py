"""Shared visibility filter — subscription-based model.

After the marketplace redesign, org auto-visibility is removed.  Resources
are visible to a user only if:

1. The user owns the resource (any visibility setting), OR
2. The user has an explicit ResourceSubscription for it.

Org-scoped resources are surfaced via subscriptions that are created when
org members subscribe from the Market page (or via auto-subscribe on
resource creation / org membership join).
